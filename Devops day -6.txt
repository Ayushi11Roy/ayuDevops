Devops day -6 

----------------------

1. Create a user named Ramesh. Add him to nobody and wheel group.


---->

useradd Ramesh
passwd Ramesh
cat /etc/group | grep -i nobody  (We are checking if the group already exists. If group doesn't exist, use: groupadd <groupname> to create group)
cat /etc/group | grep -i wheel
usermod -G wheel Ramesh
usermod -aG nobody Ramesh
cat /etc/group | grep -i ramesh

2. Create a user Deepak and password ltimindtree. Make Deepak the sudo (root) user, and give him permission so that he can add a user named jk.

--->

useradd Deepak
passwd Deepak
<Give password as ltimindtree>
sudo visudo  (open this file) 
-	You can also open vim /etc/sudoers

then search for:
root	ALL=(ALL)	ALL

Underneath it, add:

Deepak	ALL=(ALL)	/user/sbin/useradd

<save and exit>

Login as Deepak:

sudo su - Deepak
sudo useradd jk
cat /etc/passwd | grep -i jk
